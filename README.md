## Low-level Programming & Algorithm

This is a repo which contains all the project tasks at ALX. It was programmed using the C language. On a few tasks, I had help from other students in my cohort.

In each directory, using the README, I'll explain what every task does.

As I advance with the projects, I'll make updates and commit to this README, and the respective ones.
